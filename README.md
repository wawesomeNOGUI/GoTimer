# GoTimer
A simple timer that asks the user for how many minutes to sleep, counts down in the console from the sleep time specified to 0, plays the Windows alert sound, waits 1 minute and automatically restarts the timer. Nice to leave on in the background to remind yourself to take breaks during work.
